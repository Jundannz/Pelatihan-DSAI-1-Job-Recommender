Job Summary:
We’re seeking a highly analytical and hands-on Data Analyst to drive insights across product and marketing initiatives for our live mobile game. In this role, you’ll play a key part in understanding player behavior, improving retention and monetization, and supporting data-driven decision-making across the company. Partnering closely with product, marketing, and developer teams, you’ll translate complex data into actionable insights while also owning the underlying data pipelines and analytics infrastructure that power the business.

Manage data storage and transformations across S3 and Snowflake.
Orchestrate data workflows using Apache Airflow.
Ensure data quality, consistency, and reliability across the analytics stack.
Leverage GenAI/LLMs to accelerate analysis and development (SQL, Python, ETL, dashboards, documentation), and to create repeatable “analysis playbooks” and faster experiment reporting for stakeholders.
Evaluate and adopt new AI tools and workflows that improve team speed and decision quality, with appropriate validation, testing, and guardrails.
